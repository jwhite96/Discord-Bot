#### Hello There! Thank You For Viewing This GitHub Repo!

Battle Bets is a discord bot capable of creating "bets" with friends. These bets can be anything you can think of. Two or more users agree on a bet that someone created, later returning and confirming the result. But what are you betting with? A fake currency of-course! This bot is designed to be friendly interactive experience for discord users.
